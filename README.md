# FoodTech - DOM Manipulation Project

Welcome to **FoodTech**, a stylish one-page website created for a trendy bistro that decided to become the next big startup in the foodtech industry. This project was built to enhance frontend skills through various DOM manipulation exercises using vanilla JavaScript.

## 📖 Project Description

**FoodTech** is a modern, single-page application designed to mimic a hip restaurant website. It includes fun and interactive features like tab navigation, a menu generator powered by "AI", a photo gallery, and more — all coded from scratch without frontend frameworks or Bootstrap JS components.

## 🎯 Features

- ✨ **Landing section** with a description and concept photo ("Fresh and organic products!")
- 🔀 **Tab navigation** to switch between Home, Menu, and Photo Gallery
- 🍽️ **AI Menu Generator** — click a button to generate a random, gourmet-sounding dish using a mix of predefined arrays
- 💥 **Exit-intent popup** that appears when the user tries to leave the page
- 🖼️ **Photo gallery** of the restaurant in a responsive grid layout
- 🧲 **Drag & Drop functionality** for reordering photos dynamically

All features are coded using **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**, with optional **Bootstrap 5** used only for layout/styling (no JS).

## 🧪 Learning Objectives

This project helps reinforce:

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Event handling (clicks, mouse movements, drag events)
- Creating and removing elements dynamically
- Working with CSS classes and inline styles via JS
- UX/UI thinking with popup logic and user engagement

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript (no frameworks)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

🧠 Sample "AI Menu" Generator
Menu items are generated by combining items from predefined arrays:

javascript
Copier
Modifier
const mainCourses = ["Filet de turbot de la mer Noire", "Gigot d'agneau", ...];
const techniques = ["à la cocotte", "déglacé au saké", ...];
const sides = ["des châtaignes croustillantes", "un oeuf parfait", ...];
const seasonings = ["au poivre vert de Sichuan", "à l'ail noir", ...];
Example output:

"Gigot d'agneau à la cocotte, avec des châtaignes croustillantes au poivre vert de Sichuan"

📬 Exit Popup Behavior
Triggers when the user's mouse leaves the top of the screen (exit intent)

Displays a modal prompting the user to subscribe or engage

Can be dismissed by clicking outside or the close button

The background dims to highlight the modal

🖼️ Drag & Drop Gallery
Users can drag photo tiles to reorder the gallery in real time. No external libraries used — just the native dragstart, dragover, and drop events.
